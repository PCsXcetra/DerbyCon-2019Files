# DerbyCon-2019Files
This is a group of tools that I was planning on releasing During a Derbycon 2019 talk if it was accepted or with a blogpost if not.
I have also included the malware samples along with the layers of decoding for each sample. This folder is a 7Zip and password protected with the normal password of infected.

These are malicious samples so use all caution. I am not responsible if you extract and run these files and infect yourself.

That being said my tools are designed so you don't have to run the malicious code to decode what it is doing.
